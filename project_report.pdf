Abstract
The Smart Resume Builder with AI Suggestions is a web-based application designed to help students and professionals create impactful resumes. Traditional resume building is time-consuming and often lacks personalized guidance. This project leverages AI to analyze user inputs and provide tailored suggestions to improve resume quality. Built using React.js, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, and the OpenAI API (free tier), the system ensures ease of use, intelligent feedback, and professional formatting.
1. Introduction
A resume is the first impression for job seekers, yet many struggle to highlight their strengths effectively. This project addresses the challenge by creating a smart resume builder that not only allows users to enter their details but also uses AI to suggest improvements. The project aims to enhance job readiness by providing high-quality resumes in minimal time.
2. Objectives
- To design a simple and user-friendly resume builder.
- To integrate AI for personalized suggestions and improvements.
- To store and format user data efficiently.
- To generate resumes in professional templates.
- To reduce the effort and time spent in resume preparation.
3. Literature Survey
Existing resume builders (e.g., Canva, Zety) provide templates but lack intelligent suggestions. AI-powered platforms exist but are often paid or complex. Our solution bridges the gap by offering a free, simple, and intelligent resume builder that suits both students and professionals.
4. System Design & Methodology
Architecture:
- Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS (for UI).
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js.
- Database: MongoDB (to store user resume data).
- AI Integration: OpenAI API (for suggestions).
Workflow:
1. User enters personal, educational, and professional details.
2. The system stores the data securely.
3. AI analyzes input and provides suggestions (e.g., stronger wording, missing skills).
4. Resume is formatted into a downloadable template.
5. Implementation
- Frontend: A React-based form captures user inputs.
- Backend: Node.js server processes data and integrates AI suggestions.
- Database: MongoDB stores user details for later retrieval.
- AI: OpenAI API provides real-time feedback on resume content.


6. Results & Discussion
The Smart Resume Builder successfully generates resumes with AI-powered suggestions. Testing with sample data showed that resumes became more professional and concise after applying AI recommendations. The system proved effective in helping students highlight their strengths better.
7. Conclusion & Future Work
